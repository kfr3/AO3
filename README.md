Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.

This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.

Part 1 - How to download Webstorm.

Step 1: Go to www.jetbrains.com/student

Step 2: Scroll down and click the blue Apply Now button

Step 3: Fill out the information form, agree to consent questions and click apply for free products

Step 4: Go to the email you entered in the form and click the link to download the software. 

Step 5: Once the software is downloaded, open Webstorm on your computer and click new project to begin working

Part 2 - How to use Git

Step 1: Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download the appropriate version for your device

Step 2: Open Git and make sure it is running properly
Step 2.1: If using a Mac, you will have to go to brew.sh and download Homebrew by using the command line (/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" in the terminal
Step 2.2: After downloading Homebrew, run the command $ brew install git

Part 3 - Creating a Github Account and connecting it to WebStorm

Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software.
