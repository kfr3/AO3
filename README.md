Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.

This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.
